[Video-Downloader.exe]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program has been compiled from Python to binary using auto-py-to-exe [Video-Downloader.exe]
Updated version now downloads videos in 1080p / HD quality.
Running the executable requires 7-zip to be installed previously on the system.
This is to unpack the dependancies that are installed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[main-essential-build.py]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires python to be installed and all required modules:
- Tkinter
- yt-dlp

TO INSTALL MODULES
In command prompt, run the following commands :
- pip install tkinter
- pip install yt-dlp

The script uses the following python modules as a whole :
- os
- sys
- json
- requests
- subprocess
- yt-dlp
- tkinter

Alternative method to running the executable, modify the code as needed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[test-full-build.py]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requires python to be installed and all required modules : 
- Tkinter

TO INSTALL MODULES
In command prompt, run the following command :
- pip install tkinter

The script uses the following python modules as a whole :
- os
- sys
- json
- subprocess
- threading
- tkinter

REQUIRES [yt-dlp.exe] to be installed and placed in the same directory of the script as of now.
Will be changed and will integrate a system to auto install the executable.

This version is faster than the python yt-dlp module as it uses threading.
It is also more attractive for users as it displays download information live.
Not like the [main-essential-build.py].

"Works", but once the user tries to play the video using a media player they are greeted with a format error.
But if the user places the video into their editing software the file works and all sound and frames are preserved.

Older version aswell, needs to be changed and fixed.

[test-sys-vars.py]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For me, just so i can test and implement new code into the [test-full-build.py] version.
No Use.
