First Build - Complete
-------------
Doesnt work properly with subprocesses and threading
In order to fix this, have to use the yt-dlp python library instead of the exe

Both methods need ffmpeg installed ! ! 

Second Build
-------------
Brainfuck but allows me to add the functionality of alerting the user of the status of downloads
In order for this to work subprocesses and threading needs to be used with the exe build of yt-dlp

1. Download yt-dlp.exe to Main drive, likely under vtemp folder where the dir is already installed
2. Use different method of command lining the download
3. Download ffmpeg build to Main drive
4. Add ffmpeg/bin to windows environment system variables
